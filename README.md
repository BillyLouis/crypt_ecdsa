# crypt_ecdsa
To encrypt and decrypt data using asymmetric encryption. The algorithm used is the elliptical curve.
This encryption method is only software based, no hardware such as the ATECC608 is involved.

### Encryption
Command line encryption which is found in the path: <ins> ~/go/src/github.com/BillyLouis/crypt_ecdsa/cmd/encrypt/main.go </ins>



### Decryption
Command line decryption which is found in the path: <ins> ~/go/src/github.com/BillyLouis/crypt_ecdsa/cmd/decrypt/main.go </ins>
